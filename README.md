# project-checkurl
My first repository on Github for Release 0.1


This is a CLI Tool made in Node.js to take a file name as argument, then scan each valid URL found within the document for their availability.

Features:
1. Color coded outputs, ðŸŸ¢green for good links, ðŸ”´red for bad links, ðŸŸ¡ for links with errors, and âš«gray for unknown links.
2. Supports windows and unix arguments for version display.
3. Timeout is set to 5 seconds to prevent the program to freeze, other errors are catched and displayed back to client.
Arguments available: 
1. --v (or --version, /v or /version to view the current tool's version.)
2. [filename] (will scan the file of URLs and determine their availability.)
